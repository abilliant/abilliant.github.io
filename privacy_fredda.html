<ul>
<li>Where we are legally required by law to disclose your personal information.</li>
<li>To further fraud protection and reduce the risk of fraud.</li>
<li>In the event that we sell any or all of our business to the buyer.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be occasions where it will be necessary for us to disclose your personal information to third parties. We may be required by law to disclose the information, or we may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to provide the service you have requested. However, the disclosure will only be made where it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which you disclosed your personal information. Otherwise than stated above, we do not disclose personal information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any organization or person outside Abilliant unless you have authorized us to do so.</p>
<p><strong>■ Data security </strong></p>
<p>We do our best to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to make sure that your data is treated stored securely. Because the information via the internet is not totally secure and on occasion such information can be intercepted, we cannot guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically, sending such information is entirely at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>■ Rights of the party whose data is collected </strong></p>
<p>Users may log in to our website or application to search or review their own personal data. If your personal data has changed, or you discover your personal data is incorrect, you may request revision or correction at any time.</p>
<p>The party whose data is collected may request a search or review of their own personal data or may request that the party be given a copy, provided that Abilliant may collect necessary fees and costs at its discretion. When there no longer exists a purpose for collecting the data, or the prescribed period has expired, you may request that the data be deleted or that processing and use of the data cease, provided that this does not apply when the data is necessary for Abilliant in its execution of duties or business.</p>
<p>If you wish to delete any user data that has been registered with Abilliant, you may contact Abilliant by sending an email to the customer service mailbox, or alternatively, you may contact the customer service personnel of Abilliant directly. After receiving your request for deletion of personal data, Abilliant will confirm with you by email and inform you of its receipt of your message, and, Abilliant will delete the related data to the greatest extent possible (with the exception of data for which retention is required by a law or regulation, and data in connection with improper or illegal use). IMPORTANT: Abilliant may possibly be unable to completely remove your user account because of residual data left on the Internet after individual uses, and in such case, the account deletion procedure may possibly fail. In addition, to the extent permitted by laws and regulations, Abilliant reserves the right not to accept a request for account deletion.</p>
<p><strong>■ Effects of exercising rights </strong></p>
<p>If you are unwilling to provide to Abilliant and its cooperating partners the required personal data that will enable the smooth provision of Abilliant related services or allow a given transaction to be successfully completed or carried through to conclusion, and to consent to the collection, processing, use, and international transmission of such personal data by Abilliant and its cooperating partners in accordance with laws and regulations, related terms of service, and related privacy policy and its disclosures, Abilliant will respect your decision, but depending on the nature or requirements of any given service, you may, as a result, be unable to use the given service or complete the given transaction. Abilliant also reserves the right to refuse to provide any such service or to complete any such transaction.</p>
<p><strong>■ The right to amend the privacy policy</strong></p>
<p>Abilliant is entitled to amend this Privacy Policy and the related disclosures at any time, and may subsequently publish the amendments on an appropriate location of our website without giving individual notifications.
